Spindle

1. Send M5 to turn off spindle
2. Check if spindle does not give any sound and is not moving
3. Send M3 S0
4. Check if spindle does not give any sound and is not moving
5. Send M3 S5000

Movement

1. Move X axis 1mm to +
2. Move X axis 1mm to -
3. Move Y axis 1mm to +
4. Move Y axis 1mm to +
5. Move Z axis 1mm to +
6. Move Z axis 1mm to -
7. Check movement

Spindle PWM check
1. Set algoritm to 0, this is the old one with min and max rpm
2. Set M3Snnnn to value : minrpm + ((maxrpm-minrpm)/2) for example: 4035+((32607-4035)/2) = 18321
3. $D1
4. Check PWM value, must be 50.
5. Measure spindle RPM with device.
