// NOTE: The following are two examples to setup homing for 2-axis machines.
// #define HOMING_CYCLE_0 ((1<<X_AXIS)|(1<<Y_AXIS))  // NOT COMPATIBLE WITH COREXY: Homes both X-Y in one cycle. 

// #define HOMING_CYCLE_0 (1<<X_AXIS)  // COREXY COMPATIBLE: First home X
// #define HOMING_CYCLE_1 (1<<Y_AXIS)  // COREXY COMPATIBLE: Then home Y

// Number of homing cycles performed after when the machine initially jogs to limit switches.
// This help in preventing overshoot and should improve repeatability. This value should be one or
// greater.
#define N_HOMING_LOCATE_CYCLE 1 // Integer (1-128)

// After homing, Grbl will set by default the entire machine space into negative space, as is typical
// for professional CNC machines, regardless of where the limit switches are located. Uncomment this
// define to force Grbl to always set the machine origin at the homed location despite switch orientation.
// #define HOMING_FORCE_SET_ORIGIN // Uncomment to enable.

// Number of floating decimal points printed by Grbl for certain value types. These settings are
// determined by realistic and commonly observed values in CNC machines. For example, position
// values cannot be less than 0.001mm or 0.0001in, because machines can not be physically more
// precise this. So, there is likely no need to change these, but you can if you need to here.
// NOTE: Must be an integer value from 0 to ~4. More than 4 may exhibit round-off errors.
#define N_DECIMAL_COORDVALUE_INCH 4 // Coordinate or position value in inches

// If your machine has two limits switches wired in parallel to one axis, you will need to enable
// this feature. Since the two switches are sharing a single pin, there is no way for Grbl to tell
// which one is enabled. This option only effects homing, where if a limit is engaged, Grbl will
// alarm out and force the user to manually disengage the limit switch. Otherwise, if you have one
// limit switch for each axis, don't enable this option. By keeping it disabled, you can perform a
// homing cycle while on the limit switch and not have to move the machine off of it.
// #define LIMITS_TWO_SWITCHES_ON_AXES

// Allows GRBL to track and report gcode line numbers.  Enabling this means that the planning buffer
// goes from 16 to 15 to make room for the additional line number data in the plan_block_t struct
// #define USE_LINE_NUMBERS // Disabled by default. Uncomment to enable.

// Upon a successful probe cycle, this option provides immediately feedback of the probe coordinates
// through an automatically generated message. If disabled, users can still access the last probe
// coordinates through Grbl '$#' print parameters.
#define MESSAGE_PROBE_COORDINATES // Enabled by default. Comment to disable.

// Enables a second coolant control pin via the mist coolant g-code command M7 on the Arduino Uno
// analog pin 4. Only use this option if you require a second coolant control pin.
// NOTE: The M8 flood coolant control pin on analog pin 3 will still be functional regardless.

#define SAFETY_DOOR_COOLANT_DELAY 1000 // (ms)

// Inverts pin logic of the control command pins based on a mask. This essentially means you can use
// normally-closed switches on the specified pins, rather than the default normally-open switches.
// NOTE: The top option will mask and invert all control pins. The bottom option is an example of

// Inverts select limit pin states based on the following mask. This effects all limit pin functions,
// such as hard limits and homing. However, this is different from overall invert limits setting.
// This build option will invert only the limit pins defined here, and then the invert limits setting
// will be applied to all of them. This is useful when a user has a mixed set of limit pins with both
// normally-open(NO) and normally-closed(NC) switches installed on their machine.
// NOTE: PLEASE DO NOT USE THIS, unless you have a situation that needs it.
//#define INVERT_LIMIT_PIN_MASK ((1<<X_LIMIT_BIT)|(1<<Y_LIMIT_BIT)|(1<<Z_LIMIT_BIT)) // Default disabled. Uncomment to enable.

// ADVANCED CONFIGURATION OPTIONS:

// Enables code for debugging purposes. Not for general use and always in constant flux.
// #define DEBUG // Uncomment to enable. Default disabled.

// Configure rapid, feed, and spindle override settings. These values define the max and min
// allowable override values and the coarse and fine increments per command received. Please
// note the allowable values in the descriptions following each define.
#define DEFAULT_FEED_OVERRIDE           100 // 100%. Don't change this value.
#define MAX_FEED_RATE_OVERRIDE          200 // Percent of programmed feed rate (100-255). Usually 120% or 200%

#define RAPID_OVERRIDE_LOW       25 // Percent of rapid (1-99). Usually 25%.
// #define RAPID_OVERRIDE_EXTRA_LOW 5 // *NOT SUPPORTED* Percent of rapid (1-99). Usually 5%.

#define DEFAULT_SPINDLE_SPEED_OVERRIDE    100 // 100%. Don't change this value.
#define MAX_SPINDLE_SPEED_OVERRIDE        200 // Percent of programmed spindle speed (100-255). Usually 200%.

#define SPINDLE_OVERRIDE_COARSE_INCREMENT  10 // (1-99). Usually 10%.
#define SPINDLE_OVERRIDE_FINE_INCREMENT     1 // (1-99). Usually 1%.

// When a M2 or M30 program end command is executed, most g-code states are restored to their defaults.
// This compile-time option includes the restoring of the feed, rapid, and spindle speed override values
// to their default values at program end.
#define RESTORE_OVERRIDES_AFTER_PROGRAM_END // Default enabled. Comment to disable.

// The status report change for Grbl v1.1 and after also removed the ability to disable/enable most data
// fields from the report. This caused issues for GUI developers, who've had to manage several scenarios
// and configurations. The increased efficiency of the new reporting style allows for all data fields to 
// be sent without potential performance issues.
// NOTE: The options below are here only provide a way to disable certain data fields if a unique
// situation demands it, but be aware GUIs may depend on this data. If disabled, it may not be compatible.
#define REPORT_FIELD_PIN_STATE // Default enabled. Comment to disable.
#define REPORT_FIELD_CURRENT_FEED_SPEED // Default enabled. Comment to disable.
#define REPORT_FIELD_WORK_COORD_OFFSET // Default enabled. Comment to disable.
#define REPORT_FIELD_OVERRIDES // Default enabled. Comment to disable.
#define REPORT_FIELD_LINE_NUMBERS // Default enabled. Comment to disable.

// Some status report data isn't necessary for realtime, only intermittently, because the values don't
// change often. The following macros configures how many times a status report needs to be called before
// the associated data is refreshed and included in the status report. However, if one of these value
// changes, Grbl will automatically include this data in the next status report, regardless of what the
// count is at the time. This helps reduce the communication overhead involved with high frequency reporting
// and agressive streaming. There is also a busy and an idle refresh count, which sets up Grbl to send
// refreshes more often when its not doing anything important. With a good GUI, this data doesn't need
// to be refreshed very often, on the order of a several seconds.
// NOTE: WCO refresh must be 2 or greater. OVR refresh must be 1 or greater.
#define REPORT_OVR_REFRESH_BUSY_COUNT 20  // (1-255)
#define REPORT_OVR_REFRESH_IDLE_COUNT 10  // (1-255) Must be less than or equal to the busy count
#define REPORT_WCO_REFRESH_BUSY_COUNT 30  // (2-255)
#define REPORT_WCO_REFRESH_IDLE_COUNT 10  // (2-255) Must be less than or equal to the busy count

// The temporal resolution of the acceleration management subsystem. A higher number gives smoother
// acceleration, particularly noticeable on machines that run at very high feedrates, but may negatively
// impact performance. The correct value for this parameter is machine dependent, so it's advised to
// set this only as high as needed. Approximate successful values can widely range from 50 to 200 or more.
// NOTE: Changing this value also changes the execution time of a segment in the step segment buffer.
// When increasing this value, this stores less overall time in the segment buffer and vice versa. Make
// certain the step segment buffer is increased/decreased to account for these changes.
#define ACCELERATION_TICKS_PER_SECOND 100

// Adaptive Multi-Axis Step Smoothing (AMASS) is an advanced feature that does what its name implies,
// smoothing the stepping of multi-axis motions. This feature smooths motion particularly at low step
// frequencies below 10kHz, where the aliasing between axes of multi-axis motions can cause audible
// noise and shake your machine. At even lower step frequencies, AMASS adapts and provides even better
// step smoothing. See stepper.c for more details on the AMASS system works.
#define ADAPTIVE_MULTI_AXIS_STEP_SMOOTHING  // Default enabled. Comment to disable.

// Sets the maximum step rate allowed to be written as a Grbl setting. This option enables an error
// check in the settings module to prevent settings values that will exceed this limitation. The maximum
// step rate is strictly limited by the CPU speed and will change if something other than an AVR running
// at 16MHz is used.
// NOTE: For now disabled, will enable if flash space permits.
// #define MAX_STEP_RATE_HZ 30000 // Hz

// Sets which axis the tool length offset is applied. Assumes the spindle is always parallel with
// the selected axis with the tool oriented toward the negative direction. In other words, a positive
// tool length offset value is subtracted from the current location.
#define TOOL_LENGTH_OFFSET_AXIS Z_AXIS // Default z-axis. Valid values are X_AXIS, Y_AXIS, or Z_AXIS.

// With this enabled, Grbl sends back an echo of the line it has received, which has been pre-parsed (spaces
// removed, capitalized letters, no comments) and is to be immediately executed by Grbl. Echoes will not be
// sent upon a line buffer overflow, but should for all normal lines sent to Grbl. For example, if a user
// sendss the line 'g1 x1.032 y2.45 (test comment)', Grbl will echo back in the form '[echo: G1X1.032Y2.45]'.
// NOTE: Only use this for debugging purposes!! When echoing, this takes up valuable resources and can effect
// performance. If absolutely needed for normal operation, the serial write buffer should be greatly increased
// to help minimize transmission waiting within the serial write protocol.
// #define REPORT_ECHO_LINE_RECEIVED // Default disabled. Uncomment to enable.

// Minimum planner junction speed. Sets the default minimum junction speed the planner plans to at
// every buffer block junction, except for starting from rest and end of the buffer, which are always
// zero. This value controls how fast the machine moves through junctions with no regard for acceleration
// limits or angle between neighboring block line move directions. This is useful for machines that can't
// tolerate the tool dwelling for a split second, i.e. 3d printers or laser cutters. If used, this value
// should not be much greater than zero or to the minimum value necessary for the machine to work.
#define MINIMUM_JUNCTION_SPEED 0.0 // (mm/min)

// Sets the minimum feed rate the planner will allow. Any value below it will be set to this minimum
// value. This also ensures that a planned motion always completes and accounts for any floating-point
// round-off errors. Although not recommended, a lower value than 1.0 mm/min will likely work in smaller
// machines, perhaps to 0.1mm/min, but your success may vary based on multiple factors.
#define MINIMUM_FEED_RATE 1.0 // (mm/min)

// Number of arc generation iterations by small angle approximation before exact arc trajectory
// correction with expensive sin() and cos() calcualtions. This parameter maybe decreased if there
// are issues with the accuracy of the arc generations, or increased if arc execution is getting
// bogged down by too many trig calculations.
#define N_ARC_CORRECTION 12 // Integer (1-255)

// The arc G2/3 g-code standard is problematic by definition. Radius-based arcs have horrible numerical
// errors when arc at semi-circles(pi) or full-circles(2*pi). Offset-based arcs are much more accurate
// but still have a problem when arcs are full-circles (2*pi). This define accounts for the floating
// point issues when offset-based arcs are commanded as full circles, but get interpreted as extremely
// small arcs with around machine epsilon (1.2e-7rad) due to numerical round-off and precision issues.
// This define value sets the machine epsilon cutoff to determine if the arc is a full-circle or not.
// NOTE: Be very careful when adjusting this value. It should always be greater than 1.2e-7 but not too
// much greater than this. The default setting should capture most, if not all, full arc error situations.
#define ARC_ANGULAR_TRAVEL_EPSILON 5E-7 // Float (radians)

// Time delay increments performed during a dwell. The default value is set at 50ms, which provides
// a maximum time delay of roughly 55 minutes, more than enough for most any application. Increasing
// this delay will increase the maximum dwell time linearly, but also reduces the responsiveness of
// run-time command executions, like status reports, since these are performed between each dwell
// time step. Also, keep in mind that the Arduino delay timer is not very accurate for long delays.
#define DWELL_TIME_STEP 50 // Integer (1-255) (milliseconds)

// Creates a delay between the direction pin setting and corresponding step pulse by creating
// another interrupt (Timer2 compare) to manage it. The main Grbl interrupt (Timer1 compare)
// sets the direction pins, and does not immediately set the stepper pins, as it would in
// normal operation. The Timer2 compare fires next to set the stepper pins after the step
// pulse delay time, and Timer2 overflow will complete the step pulse, except now delayed
// by the step pulse time plus the step pulse delay. (Thanks langwadt for the idea!)
// NOTE: Uncomment to enable. The recommended delay must be > 3us, and, when added with the
// user-supplied step pulse time, the total time must not exceed 127us. Reported successful
// values for certain setups have ranged from 5 to 20us.
// #define STEP_PULSE_DELAY 10 // Step pulse delay in microseconds. Default disabled.

// The number of linear motions in the planner buffer to be planned at any give time. The vast
// majority of RAM that Grbl uses is based on this buffer size. Only increase if there is extra
// available RAM, like when re-compiling for a Mega2560. Or decrease if the Arduino begins to
// crash due to the lack of available RAM or if the CPU is having trouble keeping up with planning
// new incoming motions as they are executed.
// #define BLOCK_BUFFER_SIZE 16 // Uncomment to override default in planner.h.

// Governs the size of the intermediary step segment buffer between the step execution algorithm
// and the planner blocks. Each segment is set of steps executed at a constant velocity over a
// fixed time defined by ACCELERATION_TICKS_PER_SECOND. They are computed such that the planner
// block velocity profile is traced exactly. The size of this buffer governs how much step
// execution lead time there is for other Grbl processes have to compute and do their thing
// before having to come back and refill this buffer, currently at ~50msec of step moves.
// #define SEGMENT_BUFFER_SIZE 6 // Uncomment to override default in stepper.h.

// Serial send and receive buffer size. The receive buffer is often used as another streaming
// buffer to store incoming blocks to be processed by Grbl when its ready. Most streaming
// interfaces will character count and track each block send to each block response. So,
// increase the receive buffer if a deeper receive buffer is needed for streaming and avaiable
// memory allows. The send buffer primarily handles messages in Grbl. Only increase if large
// messages are sent and Grbl begins to stall, waiting to send the rest of the message.
// NOTE: Grbl generates an average status report in about 0.5msec, but the serial TX stream at
// 115200 baud will take 5 msec to transmit a typical 55 character report. Worst case reports are
// around 90-100 characters. As long as the serial TX buffer doesn't get continually maxed, Grbl
// will continue operating efficiently. Size the TX buffer around the size of a worst-case report.
// #define RX_BUFFER_SIZE 128 // (1-254) Uncomment to override defaults in serial.h
// #define TX_BUFFER_SIZE 100 // (1-254)

// Configures the position after a probing cycle during Grbl's check mode. Disabled sets
// the position to the probe target, when enabled sets the position to the start position.
// #define SET_CHECK_MODE_PROBE_TO_START // Default disabled. Uncomment to enable.

// Force Grbl to check the state of the hard limit switches when the processor detects a pin
// change inside the hard limit ISR routine. By default, Grbl will trigger the hard limits
// alarm upon any pin change, since bouncing switches can cause a state check like this to
// misread the pin. When hard limits are triggered, they should be 100% reliable, which is the
// reason that this option is disabled by default. Only if your system/electronics can guarantee
// that the switches don't bounce, we recommend enabling this option. This will help prevent
// triggering a hard limit when the machine disengages from the switch.
// NOTE: This option has no effect if SOFTWARE_DEBOUNCE is enabled.

#define HARD_LIMIT_POLLING


// Adjusts homing cycle search and locate scalars. These are the multipliers used by Grbl's
// homing cycle to ensure the limit switches are engaged and cleared through each phase of
// the cycle. The search phase uses the axes max-travel setting times the SEARCH_SCALAR to
// determine distance to look for the limit switch. Once found, the locate phase begins and
// uses the homing pull-off distance setting times the LOCATE_SCALAR to pull-off and re-engage
// the limit switch.

// Defines the EEPROM data restored upon a settings version change and `$RST=*` command. Whenever the
// the settings or other EEPROM data structure changes between Grbl versions, Grbl will automatically
// wipe and restore the EEPROM. This macro controls what data is wiped and restored. This is useful
// particularily for OEMs that need to retain certain data. For example, the BUILD_INFO string can be
// written into the Arduino EEPROM via a seperate .INO sketch to contain product data. Altering this

// to prevent this data from being over-written by a user, when used to store OEM product data.
// NOTE: If disabled and to ensure Grbl can never alter the build info line, you'll also need to enable

// By default, Grbl disables feed rate overrides for all G38.x probe cycle commands. Although this
// may be different than some pro-class machine control, it's arguable that it should be this way.

// This option will automatically disable the laser during a feed hold by invoking a spindle stop
// override immediately after coming to a stop. However, this also means that the laser still may
